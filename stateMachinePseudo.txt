BOT #1 Movements: 
1. Cross to the other side
    Once server connected, cross to other side

2. Stop when it senses the wall at the top and turn around
    Sense wall --> call stop function
    Turn around 180 degrees

3. Cross back to find the red lane
    Go forward until red sensed, then stop

4. Follow the red lane until it senses the wall at the right
    Turn left
    Follow the red lane by continuously sensing and checking that on red
    (if we don't continuously poll then how?)
    When wall sensed, stop

5. Turn left and find the yellow lane
    Turn left by 70 degrees
    Move forward until yellow lane spotted

6. Follow the yellow lane until it senses the wall at the left
    Turn 90 degrees to the left
    Continuously sensing yellow, follow yellow lane
    When wall sensed, stop

7. Turn left and return to the starting position
    Turn left by 120 degrees
    Move forward until wall sensed
    Turn 180 degrees so back in position started at

have an array of [red, yellow, blue], just reverse for bot2

General: 
Move forward at some speed until wall sensed
Turn 180 degrees
Go forward until first color found
DEVIATES
    Bot 1: Turns left for 110 degrees
    Bot 2: Turns right for 110 degrees
Go forward, continuously sensing color until wall hit
DEVIATES
    Bot 1: Turn left less than 90 degrees
    Bot 2: Turn right 110 degrees
Go forward until find next color
DEVIATES:
    Bot 1: Turn left to find yellow 
    Bot 2: Turn right to find yellow
Go forward, continuously sensiing color until wall hit
DEVIATES   
    Bot 1: Turn left 90 degrees
    Bot 2: Turn right 90 degrees
Move forward until hit wall

- can continuously poll 
- hardcode degrees but not length of movement
- one universal state machine, diff booleans (need to do all four)
- can tell bot what of the four states using server, button, changing code
